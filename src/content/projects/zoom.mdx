  Xoom is like Zoom if it got therapy, stopped gaslighting your Wi-Fi, and joined a startup with better devs. Built using Next.js (because React is life), Clerk (to make auth painless), and Stream (to make video magic), Xoom gives you crispy, real-time video calls with that “is-this-4K-or-just-vibes” feeling. Whether it's daily standups, roast sessions, or pretending to work while your camera is off, Xoom is built to handle the chaos. No downloads, no nonsense—just pure, pixel-perfect presence.

# Xit - A Git-like Version Control System in Rust

Xit is a command-line tool that emulates the basic functionalities of Git. Written entirely in Rust, this project serves as a practical learning exercise to delve into the inner workings of distributed version control systems. It's a great resource for anyone interested in systems programming, Rust, or the fundamentals of Git.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of Xit is to replicate a subset of Git's features to understand how version control systems operate from the ground up. This includes everything from initializing a repository and managing user configurations to handling file staging, committing changes, and respecting ignore rules.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (2024 Edition)
- **Key Crates**:
    - `flate2`: For data compression and decompression.
    - `sha-1`: For generating SHA-1 hashes, a core component of Git's object model.
    - `term_colr`: To provide colored and user-friendly command-line output.
    - `hex`: For encoding and decoding hexadecimal strings.
    - `walkdir`: To efficiently traverse directory trees.

## Features

- **Repository Initialization**: Create a new `.xit` repository, mirroring Git's `.git` directory structure.
- **User Configuration**: Set up a global user name and email, essential for commit attribution.
- **File Staging**: Add files to an index (staging area) to prepare them for a commit.
- **Committing**: Create commits with a message to save the state of the repository.
- **Ignoring Files**: Use a `.xitignore` file to exclude specified files and directories from being tracked.
- **Repository Status**: View the status of your repository, including staged changes, unstaged modifications, and untracked files.
- **Colored Output**: Enjoy a more intuitive user experience with colored output for status and other messages.

## File Structure

The project's source code is organized as follows:

```
src/
├── lib.rs           # Main library file, contains the core logic
├── main.rs          # Binary entry point
├── objects/         # Handles Git objects (blob, commit, tree)
│   ├── blob.rs
│   ├── commit.rs
│   ├── mod.rs
│   ├── read.rs
│   ├── tree.rs
│   └── update.rs
└── repository/      # Implements repository-level operations
    ├── add.rs
    ├── commit.rs
    ├── config.rs
    ├── index.rs
    ├── mod.rs
    ├── refs.rs
    ├── repo.rs
    ├── revert.rs
    ├── status.rs
    └── utils.rs
```

## Commands and Usage

### `xit init`

Initializes a new repository in the current directory. This creates a `.xit` directory with the necessary subdirectories and files.

```sh
$ xit init
Initialized empty Xit repository in /path/to/your/project/.xit/
```

### `xit setup`

Interactively prompts you to set up your global user name and email. This information is stored in `~/.xit/config` and is used for all your commits.

```sh
$ xit setup
Enter your name: Your Name
Enter your email: your.email@example.com
Global user name and email have been set.
```

### `xit add <file>`

Adds a file to the staging area (the index). The file's content is stored as a blob object.

```sh
$ xit add README.md
```

### `xit commit -m "<message>"`

Creates a new commit with the staged files. This involves creating a commit object and a tree object to represent the state of the repository.

```sh
$ xit commit -m "Add initial README"
[master (root-commit) 1a2b3c4] Add initial README
 1 file changed
```

### `xit status`

Shows the status of the working tree with color-coded output. It lists changes staged for commit (green), changes not staged for commit (red), and untracked files (red).

```sh
$ xit status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "xit reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "xit add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        src/
```

## Ignoring Files (.xitignore)

You can create a `.xitignore` file in the root of your repository to tell Xit to ignore certain files and directories. This works similarly to Git's `.gitignore`. By default, Xit ignores `.xit`, `.git`, and `target`.

## Future Scope

Xit is an evolving project. Here are some features that could be added in the future:

- **Branching and Merging**: Implement `branch` and `merge` commands.
- **Viewing Commit History**: Add a `log` command to display the commit history.
- **Diffing**: Introduce a `diff` command to show differences between commits, branches, or files.
- **Networking**: Add support for remote repositories (`push`, `pull`, `clone`).
- **Reverting and Resetting**: Enhance the `revert` functionality and add a `reset` command.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help improve Xit, please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

# `term_colr`

A simple and lightweight Rust library for adding colors and styles to your terminal output.

## What it is

`term_colr` is a Rust crate that allows you to easily color and style text in your command-line applications. It's designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a focus on providing a simple and expressive API through macros.

## How it works

The library uses ANSI escape codes to apply colors and styles to the text. It provides a set of macros that wrap the text with the appropriate escape codes, making it easy to add colors without having to deal with the raw escape sequences.

The library also manages a color context, allowing for nested colors and styles. When a new color or style is applied, it is pushed onto a stack. When the colored text is rendered, the color is popped off the stack, and the previous color is restored.

## Functionalities

*   **Basic Colors:** A set of macros for common foreground and background colors.
    *   Foreground: `red!`, `green!`, `blue!`, `yellow!`, `black!`, `white!`
    *   Background: `bg_red!`, `bg_green!`, `bg_blue!`, `bg_yellow!`, `bg_gray!`
*   **Text Styles:** Macros for basic text styling.
    *   `bold!`
    *   `underline!`
    *   `italic!`
*   **Advanced Colors:** Support for more advanced color models.
    *   `rgb!(r, g, b, "text")`
    *   `hsl!(h, s, l, "text")`
    *   `hsv!(h, s, v, "text")`
*   **Advanced Background Colors:** Support for advanced color models for backgrounds.
    *   `bg_rgb!(r, g, b, "text")`
    *   `bg_hsl!(h, s, l, "text")`
    *   `bg_hsv!(h, s, v, "text")`
*   **Nested Colors:** The library supports nested colors and styles, allowing you to combine different colors and styles in the same line of text.

## Example Usage

Here are a few examples of how to use `term_colr`:

### Basic Colors

```rust
use term_colr::{red, green, blue};

println!("This is a {} text.", red!("red"));
println!("This is a {} text.", green!("green"));
println!("This is a {} text.", blue!("blue"));
```

### Styling

```rust
use term_colr::{bold, underline, italic};

println!("This is a {} text.", bold!("bold"));
println!("This is an {} text.", underline!("underlined"));
println!("This is an {} text.", italic!("italic"));
```

### Nested Colors

```rust
use term_colr::{white, red, green};

println!("{}", white!("This is {} with {} color", red!("red"), green!("green")));
```

### RGB, HSL, and HSV Colors

```rust
use term_colr::{rgb, hsl, hsv};

println!("{}", rgb!(255, 0, 0, "This is bright red text"));
println!("{}", hsl!(120.0, 1.0, 0.5, "This is green text"));
println!("{}", hsv!(240.0, 1.0, 1.0, "This is blue text"));
```

## What's Next

*   **ASCII Art Generation:** I'm planning to add a feature for generating ASCII art from text, which will be a fun addition to the library.

## Technology

`term_colr` is built entirely in **Rust** and is designed to be a lightweight and efficient solution for terminal coloring.

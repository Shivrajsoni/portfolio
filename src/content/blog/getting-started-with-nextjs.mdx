# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings significant improvements to the React framework, making it easier than ever to build fast, scalable web applications. In this guide, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

### 1. Improved Performance

Next.js 15 introduces several performance optimizations:

- Faster build times
- Reduced bundle sizes
- Enhanced caching strategies

### 2. Better Developer Experience

- Improved error messages
- Enhanced debugging tools
- Streamlined configuration

## Setting Up Your First Project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Key Features

### App Router

The App Router is the recommended way to build applications in Next.js 15:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js 15</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Server Components

Server Components allow you to write components that run on the server:

```tsx
// app/blog/page.tsx
async function getPosts() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts");
  return res.json();
}

export default async function BlogPage() {
  const posts = await getPosts();

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript**: Next.js has excellent TypeScript support
2. **Optimize Images**: Use the Next.js Image component for better performance
3. **Implement SEO**: Use metadata API for better search engine optimization
4. **Add Error Boundaries**: Handle errors gracefully
